Character is a Pawn but with MovementComponent added. Thanks to that it can use
navigation and move around. Character have SkeletalMeshComponent added as well
so you can assign graphics representation by default.Letâ€™s create new Character
and name it GameplayCharacter.


USEFUL TIP: On Mobile MovementComponent is expensive so if you are doing RTS
game with lot of Characters you should extend from Pawn and implement your own
movement.

/* The UFUNCTION() Macro

The UFUNCTION macro is used above each of these functions. By itself, the
UFUNCTION macro makes the engine aware of these functions, so that they can be
included in serialization, optimization, and other engine functionality. You may
also have noticed the UCLASS macro above your new FPSGameMode and FPSCharacter
class declarations, which does the same thing but for classes, and there is also
a UPROPERTY macro for properties. There are a number of specifiers you can
supply to these macros to change the function, class, and property behaviors in
the engine, which can be found in ObjectBase.h.

}

A common FPS approach is to use 2 separate meshes. One is the normal full-body mesh, used when seeing the character from third person but hidden when in first person. The second is a "weapon and hands" mesh that is attached to the camera and is visible only to the player when the player is in a first person perspective.
