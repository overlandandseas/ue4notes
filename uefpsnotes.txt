//{NAME}ProjectGameMode.h and .cpp get generated automatically in c++ project.

//Game mode has a start play function;

//In GameMode.h
virtual void StartPlay() override;

//in GameMode.cpp

{
      Super::StartPlay();

      StartMatch();

            // this is debug text
      }
}

//This function declaration will allow you to override the StartPlay() function inherited from the `AActor` class, so that you can print a message to the screen when gameplay begins.

//Also we need to defiine a constructor;

// in GameMode.h
AFPSGameMode(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer);

//in GameMode.cpp
AFPSGameMode::AFPSGameMode(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer)
    : Super(ObjectInitializer)
{

} //this is a fun was of spacing, not.


//BE SURE TO CHANGE THE GAME MODE TO THE ONE YOU WANT IN YOUR PROJECT SETTINGS

//The Generated .h file should always be last in the declairation
